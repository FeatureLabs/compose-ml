    "[Compose](https://compose.alteryx.com) is a python library for automated prediction engineering. An end user defines an outcome of interest over the data by writing a \"labeling function\". Compose will automatically search and extract historical training examples to train machine learning examples, balance them across time, entities and label categories to reduce biases in learning process. See the [documentation](https://compose.alteryx.com) for more information.\n",
