If the label maker raises an error during the search or the ouptut labels doesn't seem right, then you will need to check the logic in the labeling function or inspect the data for any inherent errors. This is where the slice generator can help us do both. Ideally, you also want to use the slice generator during the development of your labeling function for best practice.
