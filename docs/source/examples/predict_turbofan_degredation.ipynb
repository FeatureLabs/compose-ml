    "In the first step, we generate new labels from the data by using [Compose](https://compose.alteryx.com/). In the second step, we generate features for the labels by using [Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/). In the third step, we search for the best machine learning pipeline by using [EvalML](https://evalml.alteryx.com/). \n",
