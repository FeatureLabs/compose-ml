Introduction
============

Creating labels from raw data for a machine learning problem is difficult and time consuming. This is where `ComposeML` helps by making it easier to quickly generate complex labels from raw data.

What is ComposeML?
------------------

**ComposeML** is advanced software for automating the prediction engineering process. ComposeML enables you to systematically define prediction problems by automatically extracting historical training examples to train machine learning algorithms.
